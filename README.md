# toothpick-ksp
KSP annotation processor for Toothpick.

All credits go to [olivierperez/ksp](https://github.com/olivierperez/toothpick/tree/opz/ksp) for the initial work on a KSP processor.

Bear in mind this is not (yet) a 1:1 implementation of the KAPT processor as some features are still missing.
